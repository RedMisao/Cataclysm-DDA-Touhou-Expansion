	"//": "This item grants the visible mutation which grants the enchantment. The mutation is a visible tag for the player and allows to detect it via EOC. The enchantment grants extra stats according to the formula 1 + ( 3 * var_wind_blessing_X ). Each var_X value is set by the EOC wind_blessing_eoc , that runs every 1 h and queues the independent randomization of each stat",
	"//2": "Seems enchantments from items are broken again. The mutation is being granted, but the enchantment inside is not giving any stats. Moving *both* the mutation plus the enchantment values to HOURAI_SPECIES works (it grants the +1 to all stats and it fluctuates every hour, according to the EOC), yet moving only the mutation doesn't work (does not grant the +1 to all stats nor fluctuate every hour)"
