Looks like a some sort of metallic flower or claw, with seven to nine \"thorns\" attached around the proper bullet in the middle, with the exact number varying depending on how you spin it during inspection.  Perhaps due the folding, several of these stack together on a smaller than expected volume, forming an angular, amorphous metal mass.  Trippy to say the least.",
