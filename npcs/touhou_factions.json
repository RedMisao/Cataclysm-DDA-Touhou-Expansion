The average soldier is at least as well trained as the modern infantry soldier and has better equipment (think of a M1 vs a SIG 553), the elite soldiers are capable of fulfilling several roles at once and have even better equipment. A non-specified subset are the elite operatives, which lay low until they receive orders from the superior command."
